## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. A [Mac](https://www.apple.com/mac/).
2. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.

<details>
<summary>To-Dos</summary>

- [x] List minimal system requirements (e.g., macOS version xyz) and required skills (e.g., knowledge to run the command-line interface) to install and run your application(s) here.

</details>

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Xcode and select `Open Existing Project`.
3. Select this project's [EntrepreneurChat.xcodeproj](App/EntrepreneurChat.xcodeproj).

<details>
<summary>To-Dos</summary>

- [x] Add a list of all necessary steps to install your application, e.g., how to install required libraries like Flutter.
  If a library's installation process is very complex and might change significantly within the upcoming months, you can add a link to the library's official installation manual.
- [x] Test the correctness and completeness of the installation steps on a clean machine, e.g., on a computer in the Informatikum's computer pool.
  You should also ask fellow students not participating in M-Lab for problems in understanding and executing the steps.
  __Consider this as the most critical section of your README. We do not accept "But it runs on my machine" excuses.__
- [x] If you provide multiple software components with this repository, e.g., a frontend and a backend application, consider adding a minimal and a full version of your installation description here.
  The minimal version describes how to run all components on a local computer; the full version describes (roughly) how to deploy your components, e.g., when a backend should run on a server.
- [x] Consider using virtualization tools, like [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), to minimize the installation effort for your users.
