<summary>To-Dos</summary>

- [ ] Edit the Project Title.
- [ ] Optionally, you can add useful customized [badges](https://shields.io).

## Introduction

<details>
<summary>To-Dos</summary>

- [ ] Describe __what__ application you created and explain its main features (= implemented functional requirements) and qualities (= implemented non-functional requirements).
  Example:
  We present a communication app for iOS that enables visitors of a fair to network and exchange contact information with each other.
  The app's main features are: [...] The app's main qualities are: [...]
- [ ] Describe __why__ you created this application.
  Example: This application was created during the M-Lab course 2020 at Universit√§t Hamburg for the client Hamburg Messe.
  The client required an initial prototype to facilitate the communication and exchange of fair visitors. [...]
- [ ] Include (a link to) your trailer here.
- [ ] Optionally, you can place copies of your RAD and SDD artifacts in the __media__ folder and add links to them in your description.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<details>
<summary>To-Dos</summary>

- [ ] List minimal system requirements (e.g., macOS version xyz) and required skills (e.g., knowledge to run the command-line interface) to install and run your application(s) here.

</details>

### Installation

<details>
<summary>To-Dos</summary>

- [ ] Add a list of all necessary steps to install your application, e.g., how to install required libraries like Flutter.
  If a library's installation process is very complex and might change significantly within the upcoming months, you can add a link to the library's official installation manual.
- [ ] Test the correctness and completeness of the installation steps on a clean machine, e.g., on a computer in the Informatikum's computer pool.
  You should also ask fellow students not participating in M-Lab for problems in understanding and executing the steps.
  __Consider this as the most critical section of your README. We do not accept "But it runs on my machine" excuses.__
- [ ] If you provide multiple software components with this repository, e.g., a frontend and a backend application, consider adding a minimal and a full version of your installation description here.
  The minimal version describes how to run all components on a local computer; the full version describes (roughly) how to deploy your components, e.g., when a backend should run on a server.
- [ ] Consider using virtualization tools, like [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), to minimize the installation effort for your users.

</details>

### How To Run

<details>
<summary>To-Dos</summary>

- [ ] Add a list of all necessary steps to run your application after completing the installation.

- [ ] Please indicate if the demo has limitations and until when it will be available.

</details>

## Known Issues

<details>
<summary>To-Dos</summary>

This section is optional. You should remove it if it is not necessary for your project.
