# Transferagentur

- This repository will house your application (`/App`) as well as your course deliverables (`/Deliverables`).
- Please note that you must place all of your __application code and documentation__ within the `App` folder, including the custom `README.md` file you will use to describe your application.
- This README file will remain as a guide for future visitors to this repository. Feel free to customize it with general information.
- __Important:__ Please use the `.gitignore` file in this directory to exclude unnecessary files from the Git process, especially large ___build___ directories that are automatically created during the build process of your application. Use platforms like [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) or specific GitHub Gists to collect appropriate gitignore entries. If you do not use this file properly, you will run into Git collaboration problems, like merge conflicts.
